# Rust Exploit for vsftpd 2.3.4

This Rust code is an exploit for the vsftpd 2.3.4 vulnerability. It attempts to hack a target IP address running vsftpd 2.3.4 and opens a shell on port 6200 if successful. The code utilizes the `tokio` library for asynchronous I/O operations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or create a new Rust project.
2. Build and run the code using the following commands:

```shell
cargo build
cargo run <IP_ADDRESS>
```

Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of the target vsftpd server.

## Release

The latest release of this exploit can be found on the [Release Page](https://github.com/BugsBound/exploit_vsftpd_backdoor/releases). It includes the compiled binary and the source code.

To use the release, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Release Page](https://github.com/BugsBound/exploit_vsftpd_backdoor/releases).
2. Download the release archive for the desired version.
3. Extract the contents of the archive to a desired location.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to the extracted directory.
5. Run the exploit with the following command:

```shell
./exploit_vsftpd_backdoor <IP_ADDRESS>
```

Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of the target vsftpd server.

## Features

- Checks if the provided input is a valid IP address.
- Establishes a TCP connection with the target IP on port 21.
- Verifies if the server response indicates the presence of vsFTPd 2.3.4.
- Sends the `USER` and `PASS` commands to the server.
- Opens a shell on port 6200 if authentication is successful.
