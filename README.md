# Rust Exploit for vsftpd 2.3.4

This Rust code is an exploit for the vsftpd 2.3.4 vulnerability. It attempts to hack a target IP address running vsftpd 2.3.4 and opens a shell on port 6200 if successful. The code utilizes the `tokio` library for asynchronous I/O operations.

## Prerequisites

- Rust programming language (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `tokio` crate (included in `Cargo.toml`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or create a new Rust project.
2. Build and run the code using the following commands:

```shell
cargo build
cargo run <IP_ADDRESS>
```

Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of the target vsftpd server.

## Features

- Checks if the provided input is a valid IP address.
- Establishes a TCP connection with the target IP on port 21.
- Verifies if the server response indicates the presence of vsFTPd 2.3.4.
- Sends the `USER` and `PASS` commands to the server.
- Opens a shell on port 6200 if authentication is successful.
- Allows input of shell commands from the user.
- Sends user commands to the server and displays the output.
- Exits the shell when the user inputs "exit".
